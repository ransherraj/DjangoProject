# DjangoProject
This django project is my first django project.
Here I have made a todolist where one cane store their todo items in database and retrive it when needed.
In this project "Todo List", I have added functionalities using django
One can add todo items in list, mark as completed, detete the copleted one and finally can delete all items.
